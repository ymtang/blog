**COMPARTMENT SYNDROME**

**Sites of avascular necrosis**
>* Scaphoid
>* Neck of femur
>* Neck of talus

## ***Spinal Fractures***
>*Coccygeal Fracture* -- Fall in a seated position, on a hard surface

# ***Bones***

***Trabecular Bone a.k.a. Cancellous Bone***
>Spongy, deep

***Cortical Bone a.k.a. Compact Bone***
>Dense, superficial

***Bone Matrix Composition***
>Collagen - grants tensile strength to bone
* `Type I`
* Woven bone -- immature, random,  not stress orientated
* Lamellar bone -- remodelled woven bone, organised and stress orientated, stronger but less flexible

>Alkaline phosphatase -- found on osteoblasts, a sign of osteoblast activity

>Proteoglycans

>Growth factors

>Bone mineral
* Ca + Po in hydroxyapatite form
* Compressive strength

***Osteoblast-induced osteoclast differentiation***
>Pre-osteoclast becomes osteoclast when RANKL and RANK meet

>Osteoprotegerin prevents RANKL from binding to RANK

***Teeth 'blasts***
>Recall that: Enamel is superficial, dentine is deep

>Ameloblast - enamel (closely packed collagen, hydroxyapatite crystals, Ca, Po, Mg, Fluoride)

>Odontoblast - dentine (collagen fibres in dentine extend to alveolar bone)

>Osteoblast - good old alveolar bone

## **Osteoporosis**
>Dx - low-trauma # hx, or by Bone Mineral Density

> DEXA results based on

>**T-score (reference mean of 30yo, average age of peak bone mass)** = used to assess fracture risk

>**Z-score (age adjusted)** = assess whether bone mass is unusually low

# ***Shock***

## ***Circulatory Shock***
>"*A generalised inadequacy of blood flow throughout the body, to the extent that tissues are damaged*"

>Usually to inadequate Cardiac Output from reduced blood volume or diminished cardiac pumping ability

### Causes of circulatory Shock
>Hypovolaemic -- bleeding, vomiting, diarrhoea

>Cardiogenic -- Reduced pumping ability of heart

>Vasogenic -- Septic (vasodilators from bacterial source) or Anaphylactic (Histamine from severe allergic reactions)

>Neurogenic -- Sympathetic vasomotor activity -- susequent loss of vascular tone

### Compensation mechanisms for shock
>**Vasopressin** -- causes blood vessels to vasoconstrict, causes kidney to reabsorb H20 & NaCl -- increases arterial pressure and blood volume

>**Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway**
> * Renin converts Angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I
> * ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II
> * Angiontensin II
>  * `Increased reabsorption of H20 & NaCl via kidney`
>  * Increased production of aldosterone by adrenal cortex which `increases reabsorption of H20 & NaCl via kidney`
>  * Increased production of vasopressin
>  * Increased thirst

# ***Embryological Development***

## **Stages of foetal development**
> Blastocyst - 1st 2 weeks

> Embryonic - Week 3-8
 * Limb buds first appear end of week 4

> Foetal - Week 9 onwards

***Limb Buds***
> **Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER)**
> * Proximo-distal
> * __Fgf8__
> * More time exposed to AER, more distal development

> **Zone of Polarising Activity (ZPA)**
> * Antero-posterior
> * __Sonic hedgehog__
> * Determines which side is thumb vs little finger
> * Multiple ZPAs - Mirror image digits or extra digit formation

> **Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs)**
> * Determines shape & form of hand
> * Lack of BMP signalling results in conjoined digits, webbed fingers/feet
> * BMP inhibitor - *Gremlin protein*

> **Hox**
> * Determines limb position in the trunk

> **Fgf10**
> * Limb formation in flank

> **Tbx & Pitx**
> * Influences identity of the limb
>  * Tbx2 & Tbx3 - both limbs
>  * Tbx4 - hindlimb
>  * Tbx5 - forelimb
>  * Pitx1 - hindlimb

> **Lbx1**
> * ensures correct migration of somites for limb muscle development
> * In order for muscle to form, precursors need to migrate from somites into the limbs

**Development abnormalities**
> * Syndactyly -- fusion of digits (_due to BMP or Shh disruption_)
> * Polydactyly -- extra digits (_due to Shh disruption_)
> * Triphalangeal thumb -- thumb has 3 phalanges instead of 2
> * Amelia -- Absence of entire limb (_early loss of Fgf signalling_)
> * Meromelia -- Absence of part of limb
> * Adactyly -- Absence of digits (_late loss of Fgf signalling_)

> **Thalidomide**
> * _Longer exposure to Fgf8 in AER_, __results in more distal structures with less proximal structures__

> **Genu valgum**
> * Knock-knee
> * Rickets

> **Genu varum**
> * Bow-leg
> * Rickets

# ***Muscles***

**Excitation-contraction coupling**
> * Action Potential travels from neurons to the muscle via neuromuscular junction
> * Goes along the surface membrane of muscle, till it reaches the T-tubules (extracellular space between muscle fibres)
> * AP once in T-tubules activate voltage sensors
> * Voltage sensors open up sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium channels
> * Contraction occurs with Ca release
> * Relaxation occurs when Ca is taken back into sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)

> **Myotonia** -- failure to relax at end of voluntary contraction
> * Due to abnormal Na or Cl channels maintaining membrane hyperexcitability

> **Malignant hyperthermia** -- Simultaneous release of Ca in all muscles of the patient, contraction occurs and temperature rises. Death by respiratory failure
> * Triggered by anaesthesia -- specifically halothane
> * Mutations in SR Ca release channels
> * Halothane can open the SR Ca release channels
> * Dantrolene -- antidote, blocks SR CA release

## ***Structure of Sarcomere***
***Sarcomere***
>*Between 2 neighbouring Z-lines*

***M-line***
>*Middle of the sarcomere*

***Z-line***
>*Thick dark vertical line*

***Thick filament***
>*Thick horizontal filament, consists of myosin*

***Thin filament***
>*Thin horizontal filament, consists of actin*

***H-band***
>*Thick, myosin filaments only; within A-band*

***A-band***
>*Overlapping region of both thick myosin & thin actin*

***I-band***
>*Thin, actin filaments only*

***Contraction Distances***
>* **H-bands & I-bands will decrease in distance during contraction**
>* **The lengths of the thick & thin filaments remain the same**
>* **The overall length of the A-band remains constant**

***Cross-bridges***
> 1. *Thick horizontal filament, consists of myosin*

> 2. *Thick filaments have myosin heads which are responsible for shortening*

> 3. *Cross-bridges are formed between the myosin head attaches to the thin actin filament*

> 4. *ATP is consumed when the shortening occurs*

> 5. *The myosin head then detaches*

## ***ATP***

***ATP use in muscles -- 1mM/s ATPase at maximal activity***
> 1. Cross-bridge cycling (1 ATP to shorten)

> 2. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium pumps (1 ATP to pump 2 Ca ions)

> 3. Na pump (1 ATP for 3 Na pumped out, maintains gradient)

***Sources of ATP***
> * ATP itself - 6 seconds with 6mM
> * Phosphocreatine (PCr) -> Converts ADP to ATP - 20 seconds with 20mM
> * Anaerobic glycolysis -> Glycogen to lactic acid - 3 ATP per glucose unit, 1-2 minutes
> * Aerobic glycolysis -> 39 ATP per glucose unit, 1-2 hours

> **McArdles' Disease** -- lack of myophosphorylase, enzyme present in muscle to break down glycogen.

> * Oxidative phosphorylation can only occur for glucose or fatty acids

> * Results in rapid painful fatigue on exertion, but no lactica acid production

> * Normal at rest, or on gentle exercise

**Atrophy**
> Smaller, thinner muscles with disuse

> **Number of cells constant, less contractile proteins within cell**

> Starvation, old age (sarcopenia), cachexia due to infection or malignancy

**Hypertrophy**
> Different from hyperplasia -- Increase in number of cells from proliferation

> **Increase in cell size**  

# ***Pain***

# ***Opioids***
>**Actions**
> * Analgesia - Strong pain relief
> * Euphoria - 'rush'
> * Impaired cough reflex i.e. anti-tussive
> * Constipation - Side effect
> * _Respiratory depression_ - MAIN cause of death
> * Nausea & vomiting
> * Dependence - withdrawal & craving
> * Miosis - constricted pupils might be indicative of opioid use
> * Pruritis - itching associated with IV or intrathecal (spinal) administration

>**Receptors**

>* Targets G-protein coupled Receptors
>* Agonist
>* Inhibits GABA, Glutamate, dopamine neurons
>* 3 receptor types: kappa, delta & mu

>  * Kappa
>    * Produces analgesia, most drugs are mixed mu-partial & kappa-agonists
>    * Dysphoria (unease)
>    * Hallucinations
>    * Diuresis (excessive urine production)
>    * Better in females than males

>  * Delta
>    * Some analgesia, less than through mu-receptor
>    * May produce seizures when activated
>    * Receptors may not usually be on the cell surface

>  * Mu
>    * Strong analgesia
>    * However, side effects aplenty -- constipation, nausea, respiratory depression, reduced cough reflex, tolerance & dependence
>    * Morphine, heroin & codeine, including other common opioid analgesics are mu-agonists
>    * Naloxone, naltrexone are mu-antagonists (ANTIDOTE!) and also kappa-, delta-antagonists at higher concentrations

**Mechanism of action**
> Release of noradrenaline, serotonin & opioids in spinal cord

>* Less excitable spinal cord neurons

>* Less glutamate & substance P released in spinal cord

> Directly inhibits primary afferent nerve fibres at spinal cord, noxious stimuli is thus unable to reach the brain

**Euphoria & reward**
> Opioids increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens to produce reward and euphoria

**Naloxone**
> Short acting

**Naltrexone**
> Long acting
