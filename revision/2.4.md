# Calcium & Phosphate Homeostasis
1.1kg [Ca] in body  
99% in bone & teeth  
Blood [Ca] = 2.3 - 2.5 mmol/L  
## Calcium concentrations in blood & ECF

> Short term __decrease in ECF [Ca]__
> 1. Increased permeability of cells to [Na] -- due to local [Ca] effect on ion channel permeability
> 2. Partial depolarisation occurs
> 3. Muscles spasm, tetany, pins & needles, seizures

> Short term __increase in ECF [Ca]__
> 1. Decreased permeability of cells to [Na]
> 2. Hyperpolarisation occurs
> 3. neurological dysfunction, cardiac arrythmias > 4. constipation, anorexia, nausea -- leads to dehydration
> 5. [Ca] induced diuresis -- increased urine production, leads to dehydration

>`Long term increase in [Ca] leads to kidney calcification & stones`

## Phosphate concentrations in blood & ECF

>Normal range: 0.8 - 1.4 mmol/L, will be higher in children

> High [Po] long term -- soft tissue mineral deposition

> Low [Po] long term -- inadequate bone mineralisation

* Low [Po] directly makes the kidney conserve [Po] so it doesn't get pissed out
* Low [Po] causes kidney to make more calcitriol from 25(OH)...
  * Calcitriol makes the gut actively absorb [Ca] & [Po]
  * Calcitriol increases bone resorption (short term, minor effect)
* Extra [Ca] is pissed out (note the lack of PTH involvement for [Po] homeostasis)

## Hormones involved in mineral homeostasis
### PTH - Parathyroid hormone

>* Released when low [Ca] detected by receptors
>  * Increases calcitriol production
>* Countered by high [Ca]
>* Reduces [Po] reabsorption, dumping in urine

Low blood [Ca] results in:
* PTH makes the kidney conserve [Ca] and increases bone resorption as a short-term measure to restore blood [Ca]
* PTH makes the kidney dump [Po] in urine, [Po] will remain unchanged since it is also being released from bone

**PTH largely affects osteoblasts**  
**PTH has a lesser effect on osteoclasts**  
**PTH suppresses sclerostin & stimulates Wnt signalling for bone formation**

### FGF23 - Fibroblast Growth Factor 23
Main role is [Po] regulation
>* Produced by osteocytes
>* Acts on kidney
>  * Increased [Po] wasting
>  * Decreased calcitriol production
>  * Increased calcitriol degradation
>* FGF23 production stimulated by:
>  * calcitriol
>  * PTH
>  * High [Po]

>Excess FGF23
>* low [Po]
>* low calcitriol
>* osteomalacia -- softening of bones
>* rickets in children

### Calcitonin
>* Produced by parafollicular cells in C cells of thyroid gland
>* Released by:
>  * gastric hormones
>  * pentagastrin
>  * Increased [Ca] levels

>Primarily acts to reduce blood [Ca] levels -- opposes effects of PTH


### Effect of hormone levels
* High PTH leads to hypercalcaemia (PTH is main regulator of [Ca])
* Low PTH leads to hypocalcaemia (PTH is main regulator of [Ca])
* High FGF23 leads to hypophosphataemia (_FGF23 regulates [Po] but having excess FGF23 long term leads to decreased [Po]_, RARELY HAPPENS)
* Mild to moderate Vitamin D insufficiency increases PTH, which will commence bone resorption to compensate for low [Ca] in the short term
* Severe Vitamin D deficiency, inability to resorb bone or even mineralise bone due to low [Ca] & [Po]
  * Low blood [Ca] & [Po]
  * Osteomalacia (bone softening) & rickets (in children, widened growth plate, flared epiphysis)

## Vitamin D

**Sources of Vitamin D**
>* Sunlight -- main source
>  * Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED) -- UV exposure to cause faint redness
>  * 15% body surface exposure to 1/3 MED
>* Diet -- secondary source
>  * Fatty fish, meat, liver, eggs, fortified foods
>  * Supplements -  1000IU Vit D3

**Metabolism of Vitamin D**
>1. 7-dehydrocholesterol -- UV from sunlight
>2. Vitamin D a.k.a. cholecalciferol
>3. 25(OH) vitamin D -- Conversion from VitD to 25(OH)... done in the liver
>  * 25(OH) vitamin D is also the measure for Vit D status
>4. CONVERSION OF 25(OH) to 1,25(OH) a.k.a. calcitriol -- done in kidney and other tissues
>  * Regulated process, increased conversion by:
>      * PTH (low [Ca])
>      * Low [Po]
>      * Growth
>      * Pregnancy

>***Calcitriol IS 1,25(OH) Vit D***
> * Increases [Ca] absorption in gut
> * Release of [Ca] from bone
> * Re-uptake of [Ca]by kidney

>**Main function of calcitriol**
>* Get [Ca] & [Po] from food to make bone mineral
>* Although in the short-term, calcitriol (and PTH) release [Ca] & [Po] from bone

### Vitamin D deficiency
* Mild to moderate deficiency -- Blood [Ca] & [Po] normal
  * Slight increase in PTH
  * PTH causes resorption of bone to release [Ca] & [Po] into blood
  * Reduced bone density resulting in osteoporosis  
  Impaired muscle function -- increased risk of falls & fractures
* Severe deficiency
  * Unable to actively absorb [Ca] & [Po] from the gut
  * Large increase in PTH in a bid to compensate
    * High [Po] wasting due to PTH -- results in a low [Po]
    * Unable to mineralise bone & maintain cartilage organisation due to low [Ca] & [Po]
    * Increased resorption to compensate -- cannot last in the long-term
  * Ultimately:
    * Rickets (in children, at growth plate & epiphyses)
    * Osteomalacia (soft, painful bones)

### Risk groups for Vitamin D deficiency

>* Old people in residential care
>* Geriatric admissions to hospital
>* Dark skinned people
>* Infants of mothers with low Vit D levels -- might have rickets
>* Chronically ill individuals


## Tissues involved in [Ca] & [Po] Homeostasis
**Gut**  
Absorption of dietary [Ca] & [Po] from food
Passive absorption, only a small fraction will be absorbed  
Active absorption, stimulated by calcitriol (Both [Ca] & [Po])

**Bone**  
[Ca] & [Po] needed for bone mineralisation
* _Hydroxyapatite_ - Provides compressive strength

Bone acts as a store of [Ca] & [Po]
* Bone turnover -- releases or stores minerals  
  * Resorption -- releases [Ca] & [Po] into blood
  * Formation/mineralisation -- deposits [Ca] & [Po] as bone ("_storage_")

**Kidney**  
Site of excretion or reabsorption of [Ca] & [Po]  
* [Ca]
  * Excretion of [Ca] in urine if blood [Ca] is high
  * Reabsorption of [Ca] by action of PTH
* [Po]
  * PTH reduces [Po] reabsorption, excreted in urine
  * Low [Po] will increase [Po] reabsorption
  * PTH stimulates calcitriol production

# Osteoporosis
## Determinants of bone mass
* Genetics
* Age
  * Peak bone mass at 20 - 30 yo
    * Adult bone mass depends on peak bone density & rate of loss from peak density
* Mechanical loading
  * Exercise -- Bones are dynamic & able to remodel    
  * Resistance to deformity
    * Osteocytes produce sclerostin, negative regulator of bone mass
    * Loading decreases sclerostin secretion
  * Gravity & weight-bearing -- maintenance of bone mass & muscle tone
  * Inactivity -- loss of bone mass & muscle tone
* Mineral balance
  * Calcium intake: recommended 800-1200mg/day
    * PTH will respond to low blood [Ca] by increasing bone resorption to release [Ca] -- end result is decreased bone density
* Vitamin D levels
  * Need Vitamin D to:
    * Actively absorb [Ca] from the gut
    * Mineralise bone
    * Normal muscle function
  * Diet, UV exposure are sources of Vitamin D   
* PTH levels
  * Intermittent PTH levels stimulate bone formation
    * Need _some, but not too much_ resorption for formation - paradoxical but true...
  * High PTH levels stimulate bone resorption
* Sex steroid levels
  * Oestrogen & androgens maintain balance between bone formation & resorption
  * Sex steroids keep bone cells alive (osteoblasts & osteocytes live longer)
  * Androgens give males bigger, mechanically stronger bones
  * Oestrogen is anti-resorptive -- reduces bone turnover rate
    * Coupling of resorption & mineralisation to work in tandem
  * *Sex steroid deficiency*
    * Impaired coupling results in net bone loss
    * Anorexia
    * Congenital deficiency
    * Alcoholism
    * Menopause (with age)
  * Hormone replacement therapies reduce rate of spine, hip fractures but bring in a host of other problems

**Effect of glucocorticoids**  
Catabolic effect on bone mass  
* &#8659; [Ca] absorption in gut
* &#8657; [Ca] dumping in kidney
* &#8659; in replacement osteoblast population & viability
* &#8659; IGF-1
* &#8659; bone formation  

**Wnt pathway & Bone**
* Wnt signalling promoted will increase transcription of genes for bone formation
* Sclerostin inhibits Wnt, which will not result in bone formation down the line

## Fracture risk
* DEXA - measure bone mineral density
  * __T-score - compared to peak bone mass at age 30__
    * Used to assess fracture risk
  * __Z-score - age-adjusted__
    * Used to assess expected bone density (unusually low or not)  


>**T-scores are diagnostic**
* T-score: -1.0 or more = Normal
* T-score: Between -1.0 to -2.5 = Osteopaenia (mild-moderate loss of bone density)
* T-score: BMD < 2.5 standard deviations below young normal mean
  * T-score of -2.6 = Osteoporosis


* *Osteoporotic bone*
  * Less dense from lower mineralisation
  * Loss of horizontal struts -- lower buckling load
  * Deeper resorption cavities -- concentrated areas of mechanical stress where fractures tend to occur

### ***Osteoporosis is largely due to a negative calcium balance***
* **More Calcium is lost in urine & faeces than reabsorbed**

#### Management of Osteoporosis
Presence of low-trauma fractures, or Hx of low-trauma fractures
* Predictive of new osteoporotic fractures
* Tackle modifiable risk factors (resolve deficiencies, cessation of harmful habits)

## Specific pharmacotherapy for Osteoporosis
**Inhibitors of bone resorption**
* Raloxifene (SERM - selective estrogen receptor modulator)
* Bisphosphonates (encourage osteoclast apoptosis)
* Strontium Ranelate (&#8657; bone deposition by osteoblasts, &#8659; bone resorption by osteoclasts)
* RANKL inhibitor (prevents pre-osteoclasts becoming osteoclasts)

**Stimulator of bone formation**
* PTH (intermittently)

**Supplements for homeostasis**
* Calcium
* Vitamin D

# Rickets
* Occurs in children, need growth plate to be present
  * Increased width of growth plate
  * Flared epiphyses

# Osteomalacia
* Increased osteoid
  * Collagen matrix has been laid down, but remains to be mineralised
* Occurs throughout the entire bone, at all ages of life

### ***Osteomalacia is due to Vitamin D deficiency that causes both low [Ca] & [Po]***
* **Prevents bone mineralisation from occurring in the osteoid = soft bones**

# Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
X-linked recessive  
Boys - XY affected, Girls - XX carriers  
Normal muscles initially  
Increased muscle weakness with age  
Degeneration > repair  
Mutation of dystrophin gene -- dystrophin protein anchors sarcomere to membrane

# Gait deviations
* Foot slap
  * weakness of ankle dorsiflexors
* Antalgic gait
  * avoiding weight-bearing on affected side
* Hemiplegic gait
  * stroke, unilateral weakness/paralysis
* Parkinsonian gait
  * Shuffling, freezing
* Anterior trunk lean
  * Quadriceps weakness
* Trendelenburg gait
  * Weakness of LL abductor muscles, gluteus medius & minimus
  * Superior gluteal nerve lesion a possible cause
