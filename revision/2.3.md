# Lower Back Pain
>* Common

>* Red flag LBP vs non-specific LBP

>* Radiates to buttocks & upper thighs

## **What can happen to the anatomy?**

**Nucleus pulposus**
>* Loss of proteoglycans (PG) -- PG retains water
>  * Reduced resistance to compression
>* Cell death
>* Calcification
>* Nucleus extrusion (due to disc herniation, the most common cause)
>  * Spinal cord compression
>  * Radiculopathy

**Annulus Fibrosus**
>* Fissures, tears
>  * Leads to disc herniation -- allowing the annulus pulposus to herniate and compress nerve root
>* Vessel/nerve ingrowth
>  * Inflammation, granulation
>* Posterior bulge

**Cartilage endplate (CEP)**
>* Calcification

**Subchondral bone**
>* Sclerosis, increased BMD (local & systemic)

>* Inflammation & remodeling

>* Schmorl's nodes & fractures
>  * Schmorl's = Intra-vertebral herniation, nucleus pulposus pushes through the vertebral body endplate into adjacent vertebra
>  * Isthmic (spinal) fracture
>  * Spondylolisthesis -- forward displacement of vertebral bone

**Supra- & inter-spinous ligaments**
>* Enlargement

>* Loss of material properties

Muscle atrophy & fatty infiltration

OA of facet joints

## Imaging LBP

### **Only after considering red flags**
>***RED FLAGS***
>* Fever, night sweats

>* Immunosuppression

>* Hx of malignancy or unexplained severe, sudden weight loss

>* Trauma

>* Prolonged use of corticosteroids -- Osteoporosis

>* Neuroloical S&Sx -- Cauda equina syndrome

>* Failure to improve after 4-6 weeks of conservative LBP therapy

## Diseases causing LBP or Red Flag Conditions
>* Cancer

>   * Trauma

>    **Treatment**
>   * Urgent surgical decompression


>* Vertebral fractures (Most common serious cause of back pain)
>  * Hx of Osteoporosis
>  * Prolonged corticosteroid use
>  * Trauma
>  * Age >70
>  * Female


>* Ankylosing spondylitis (Bamboo spine)
>  * Morning stiffness
>  * Improvement with exercise
>  * Night pain
>  * Younger age
>  * Male
>  * Autoimmune


**Sciatica**
>* Leg pain
>* Radicular (follows nerve root)
>* Often with sensory changes
>* Commonly L5, S1 (below the knee)

**Common causes of sciatica**
>* Disk herniation
>  * Herniation of nucleus pulposus through a torn annulus fibrosus
>* Spondylolisthesis
>  * Forward displacement of vertebra
>* Foraminal Stenosis
>  * Narrowing of the spinal canal
>    * Can be due to apophyseal joint hypertrophy or ligamentous hypertrophy (posterior longitudinal ligament, ligamenta flava)
>* Synovial Cysts
>  * Cyst develops as a result of apophyseal joint degeneration

#### Surgery for non-specific LBP
> **Options**

> 1. Fusion of vertebrae
> 2. Disc replacement

> ***Consider cost, harm, little marginal benefit***

#### Surgery for sciatica
> **Options**

>1. Discectomy -- removal of portion of herniated disc
>2. Laminectomy -- removal of spinous processes & lamina

> ***Consider cost, harm, little marginal benefit***

#### Injection therapy for back & leg pain
> Corticosteroids & local anaesthetic injected into spine

> ***Consider cost, harm, little marginal benefit***

**Ankylosing Spondylitis**
>* Male > Female
>* Peak age onset 20-30yo
>* Improvement with exercise, no improvement with rest
>* Affects spine & peripheral joints, mostly back symptoms
>* Pain at night, early morning stiffness
>* Sacroiliitis (buttock pain) - required for diagnosis
>* Inflammation occurs at enthesis (where tendon attaches to bone)
>  * costovertebral, manubriosternal, sternoclavicular, costochondral
>* Loss of lumbar lordosis
>* Reduced back movements
>* Reduced chest expansion
>
>
>* Extraspinal features  
>  * Peripheral arthritis
>  * Large joints (hips, knees, shoulders, ankles)
>
>
>* Extra-articular features
>  * Anterior uveitis (inflamed eyes)
>  * Inflammatory bowel disease
>  * Restrictive lung disease
>    * Restricted chest wall, due to spinal stiffness
>    * Pulmonary fibrosis (apical zones)
>  * Aortic valve disease - incompetence
>  * Psoriasis
>
>**Investigations**
>* Usually normal Hb, WCC, platelets
>* Elevated ESR & CRP (inflammation)
>  * Especially with peripheral arthritis
>  * NOT ALWAYS with spinal disease
>* X-rays of sacroiliac joints and spine
>  * 5-6 years for changes
>  * Sacroiliitis - needed for diagnosis
>  * Syndesmophytes (Bony bridging between vertebrae) in the spine (Bamboo ridge appearance)
>* Test for HLA-B27 antigen
>  * Present in 90-95% of AS patients
>  * Result is supportive, not diagnostic
>
>**Management**
>* Exercise
>* NSAIDs - first line therapy
>* TNF inhibitors (biologic agents)
>  * Good response, reduction in radiographic progress
>  * Consider side effects: TB reactivation etc.
>* Salazopyrin -- anti-inflammatory
>  * Useful for peripheral arthritis

# **NSAIDs**
**Action**
>* Analgesic
>* Antipyretic
>* Anti-inflammatory @ higher doses

**Mechanism**
>* Inhibition of COX (cyclo-oxygenase) by preventing arachidonic acid
>* Inhibition of COX-1 - GI toxicity
>  * Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis -- responsible for vasodilatation & vascular permeability, pyrogenic effect
>    `Prostaglandins potentiate pain by other inflammation mediators`
>    * GI tract side effects:
>    * dyspepsia, nausea, gastritis, GI bleeding, GI perforation
>* Inhibition of COX-2
>  * Anti-inflammatory effect
>  * No cardioprotection = increased incidence of myocardial infarction & other CVEs

Thromboxane A2 - Stimulates blood clotting
>* Activates new platelets
>* Increases platelet aggregation

> Aspirin binds to COX-1, prevents TXA2 production

# **Corticosteroids**
>1. Mineralocorticoids - *salt-retaining activity*
>2. Glucocorticoids - *Affect carbohydrate & protein metabolism as well as salt-retaining activity*
>  * Synthetic glucocorticoids have little to no salt-retaining activity
>  * Used to suppress inflammation, allergy & immune responses
>      * Metabolic effect - conversion of protein to glycogen
>      * Suppress inflammation by suppressing gene expression
>      * Immunosuppression by depressing macrophage & Tcells (CD4 especially), inhibition of IL-1, IL-2, & antibody production

>**Side effects**
>* Cushing-like symptoms
>* Steroid use diabetes mellitus due to hyperglycaemia
>* Muscle wasting & weakness, skin thinning due to inhibition of protein synthesis
>* Osteoporosis from increased bone catabolism --low osteocalcin required for bone building
>* Fluid retention, hypertension
>* Adrenal suppression & insufficiency
>* Infection reactivation - TB
>* Psychosis, cataracts, glaucoma, peptic ulcers
