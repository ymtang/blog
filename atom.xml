    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Failure-to-avoid-pitfalls"><a href="#Failure-to-avoid-pitfalls" class="headerlink" title="Failure to avoid pitfalls"></a>Failure to avoid pitfalls</h2><p>Didn’t do so well for 1RSA1. That’s a fact. Trying to avoid making the same mistakes next block. For now, it’s damage control and cram-time.</p>
<h2 id="Having-a-system"><a href="#Having-a-system" class="headerlink" title="Having a system"></a>Having a system</h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“Do you have a system?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear that ALOT during clinical day. Says quite a bit about getting things done… Systematically. Reflecting on how I did things in undergrad or even earlier – I’m not a systematic person at all.</p>
<p>Now my bro and I are trying to go paperless and transition to digital media. The principal reasons for doing so are two-fold: Not having to buy paper and ink, and being able to download the damned slides for lecture whenever they are uploaded late/have any last minute changes. (<em>Considering the running cost for printers though, and how much we spent buying the printers makes my heart sink</em>)</p>
<p>So we went through (IMO) a 2, 3-month long hellish quagmire getting crappy <em>Chuwi</em> brand Chinese tablets. Never again. You really get what you pay for. Quality control is not one of them. That wasted so much time and generated so much frustration, it just added on to my overflowing plate. Still wanted to go all digital though. So we got <em>Cube</em> brand Chinese tablets now. Hoping nothing bad crops up along the way now. It’s a gamble with this area of Chinese industry.</p>
<h3 id="Other-recurring-phrases-I-hear"><a href="#Other-recurring-phrases-I-hear" class="headerlink" title="Other recurring phrases I hear"></a>Other recurring phrases I hear</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Let’s make a start…”</em><br><code>It was &quot;Let&#39;s get started...&quot; back in WA</code></p>
<p><em>“Does that make sense?” – after listening to an explanation, usually from peers</em><br><code>Sorry, it&#39;s clear as mud to me, most of the time... Also, is it just me, or this phrase seems to either be used a lot in NSW, or in degrees with a scientific background???</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-3-A’s"><a href="#The-3-A’s" class="headerlink" title="The 3 A’s"></a>The 3 A’s</h2><p>During the road trip in Melbourne, Victoria, 大姐 was regaling some words of wisdom she had learnt from one of the tutors she had at Westmead.<br>As per the heading – the three A’s are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Availability - Being available to catch opportunities that might arise</li>
<li>Affable - Being able to get along with people (it’s a team environment)</li>
<li>Average - Being able to do anything without messing up<br>(Actually, I had to do a quick Google because I forgot the first A. Apparently the search results pointed to a TED talk)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first few things that came to mind were: maxim, dogma, axiom and platitude<br>Here’re their definitions:</p>
<p>maxim - <em>a short, pithy statement expressing a general truth or rule of conduct.</em></p>
<p>dogma - <em>a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true.</em></p>
<p>axiom - <em>a statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true.</em></p>
<p>platitude - <em>a remark or statement, especially one with a moral content, that has been used too often to be interesting or thoughtful.</em></p>
<p>First three were variations on a theme, last was probably a value judgement on my part (must be the cynic in me).<br>BUT it was still the first time I’d heard of the concept and what resonated with me was that I feel that I can live with 2/3 of the stipulations: Availability and Average</p>

    <title>Why Medical School?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Why-Medical-School"><a href="#Why-Medical-School" class="headerlink" title="Why Medical School?!"></a>Why Medical School?!</h2><p>  My Dad wanted me to do a professional degree. I liked the idea of being a professional. I always wanted to get into medical school I’d say. I didn’t like law after having to do a complementary unit in undergrad. I definitely didn’t have the chops for engineering; my relatives kept stressing the notion of avoiding reading engineering in university. Alas, I couldn’t get into medical school as an undergraduate. I had mucked around too much for my own good.</p>
<h2 id="Was-it-for-the-money"><a href="#Was-it-for-the-money" class="headerlink" title="Was it for the money?"></a>Was it for the money?</h2><p>  Initially, not really. After doing an internship, considering remuneration, all the more it reinforced my belief that a physician’s salary (most of the time) is commensurate of their degree.</p>
<h2 id="Was-it-for-the-prestige"><a href="#Was-it-for-the-prestige" class="headerlink" title="Was it for the prestige?"></a>Was it for the prestige?</h2><p>  This one hit me more squarely. The respect and being the first ones in the family to be able to get it were of great importance in my book.</p>
<h2 id="Why-not-my-previous-industry"><a href="#Why-not-my-previous-industry" class="headerlink" title="Why not my previous industry?"></a>Why not my previous industry?</h2><p>  I’ll be honest. I did only an internship. Never held an FTE position. But I knew it wasn’t for me.</p>
<h2 id="I’ll-add-some-other-push-factors"><a href="#I’ll-add-some-other-push-factors" class="headerlink" title="I’ll add some other push factors:"></a>I’ll add some other push factors:</h2><p>  My friends who are medical students or physicians already. They were instrumental in inspiring me to give it a go.<br>  Cliche: Being able to help people.</p>
